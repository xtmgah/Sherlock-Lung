# Sherlock-Lung
This repository contains bioinformatics analysis scripts and R code for visualization, developed for the **Sherlock-_Lung_** project. Sherlock-_Lung_ is a comprehensive study that aims to trace lung cancer etiology in never smokers by analyzing genomic data in tumor and surrounding lung tissue.

## Sherlock-Lung Manuscripts
The folder **`Sherlock-Lung Manuscripts`** includes scripts and analysis code supporting the following publications:
- [**Deciphering lung adenocarcinoma evolution and the role of LINE-1 retrotransposition**]()
- [**The mutagenic forces shaping the genomic landscape of lung cancer in never-smokers**](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.05.15.24307318v1)

## Sherlock-Lung Pipeline
Major scripts and workflows utilized for whole-genome sequencing analyses in the Sherlock-Lung project.

## Sherlock-Lung Pilot Study Pipeline
Bioinformatics pipeline specifically created for the Sherlock-Lung pilot study, detailed in the manuscript:
- [**Genomic and evolutionary classification of lung cancer in never-smokers**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-021-00920-0)
