# Sherlock-Lung
This repository contains bioinformatics analysis scripts and R code for visualization, developed for the Sherlock-_Lung_ project. Sherlock-_Lung_ is a comprehensive study that aims to trace lung cancer etiology in never smokers by analyzing genomic data in tumor and surrounding lung tissue.

Sherlock-Lung Manuscripts
The folder Sherlock-Lung Manuscripts includes scripts and analysis code supporting the following publications:
Deciphering lung adenocarcinoma evolution and the role of LINE-1 retrotransposition
The mutagenic forces shaping the genomic landscape of lung cancer in never-smokers

Sherlock-Lung Pipeline
Major scripts and workflows utilized for whole-genome sequencing analyses in the Sherlock-Lung project.

Sherlock-Lung Pilot Study Pipeline
Bioinformatics pipeline specifically created for the Sherlock-Lung pilot study, detailed in the manuscript:
Genomic and evolutionary classification of lung cancer in never-smokers
