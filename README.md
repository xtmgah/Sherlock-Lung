# Sherlock-Lung
This repository contains bioinformatics analysis scripts and R code for visualization, developed for the **Sherlock-_Lung_** project. Sherlock-_Lung_ is a comprehensive study that aims to trace lung cancer etiology in never smokers by analyzing genomic data in tumor and surrounding lung tissue.

## Sherlock-Lung Manuscripts
The folder **`Sherlock-Lung Manuscripts`** includes scripts and analysis code supporting the following publications:
- [**Deciphering lung adenocarcinoma evolution and the role of LINE-1 retrotransposition**](https://github.com/xtmgah/Sherlock-Lung/tree/main/Sherlock-Lung%20Manuscripts/Deciphering%20lung%20adenocarcinoma%20evolution%20and%20the%20role%20of%20LINE-1%20retrotransposition); [**Paper Link**](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.03.14.643063v1)
- [**The mutagenic forces shaping the genomic landscape of lung cancer in never-smokers**](https://github.com/xtmgah/Sherlock-Lung/tree/main/Sherlock-Lung%20Manuscripts/The%20mutagenic%20forces%20shaping%20the%20genomic%20landscape%20of%20lung%20cancer%20in%20never-smokers); [**Paper Link**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09219-0)

## Sherlock-Lung Pipeline
Major scripts and workflows utilized for whole-genome sequencing analyses in the Sherlock-Lung project.
